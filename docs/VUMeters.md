# RPi-Controlled VU Meter Display Project Summary

## Project Overview
Building a digital audio system with authentic analog VU meters on the front panel, combining the aesthetic appeal of real meters with the precision and flexibility of digital control.

## Power Solutions for VU Meter Lamps

### Initial Considerations
- VU meter lamps typically spec'd for 6V AC
- USB-C supplies provide 5V DC (would work at ~70% brightness)
- 6V AC RMS = ~8.5V peak, so 5V DC gives about 70% power (5²/6² = 0.69)

### Final Solution: RPi PWM Control
Since RPi is already in the system:
- Use RPi PWM output (GPIO 12, 13, 18, or 19)
- Motor driver board as power amplifier
- PWM frequency >100Hz (ideally 1kHz+) to avoid flicker
- Enables software brightness control, automation, and remote adjustment

## VU Meter Movement Specifications

### Electrical Characteristics
- **Voltage**: 1-3V DC across meter movement
- **Current**: 1-5mA for full-scale deflection (some precision units use 200µA)
- **Internal Resistance**: 1kΩ to 5kΩ typical
- **Drive Method**: RPi GPIO through motor driver (GPIO can source several mA at 3.3V)

### Standard VU Meter Characteristics
- Based on ANSI C16.5-1942 standard
- 0 VU = +4 dBu = 1.228V RMS
- Logarithmic response (dB scale)
- Specific ballistics requirements (see below)

## Audio Processing and VU Ballistics

### Signal Chain
1. **Audio Monitoring**: Tap I2S audio stream before DAC
2. **RMS Calculation**: Process audio samples for RMS level
3. **VU Ballistics**: Apply proper integration time and response
4. **Scaling**: Convert to appropriate PWM duty cycle
5. **Output**: Drive meter movement via PWM/motor driver

### VU Meter Ballistics Implementation

#### Standard VU Response Characteristics
- **Integration Time**: 300ms time constant
- **Rise Time**: 99% of steady-state reading in 300ms
- **Overshoot**: Minimal overshoot on transients
- **Frequency Weighting**: Flat response 35Hz-10kHz, with defined roll-off outside this range

#### Mathematical Implementation
```python
# VU Ballistics Algorithm (simplified)
class VUMeter:
    def __init__(self, sample_rate=44100):
        self.fs = sample_rate
        self.tc = 0.3  # 300ms time constant
        self.alpha = 1 - exp(-1/(self.fs * self.tc))  # smoothing factor
        self.vu_state = 0
        
    def process_sample(self, audio_sample):
        # Calculate instantaneous power
        power = audio_sample ** 2
        
        # Apply VU ballistics (exponential smoothing)
        self.vu_state = self.alpha * power + (1 - self.alpha) * self.vu_state
        
        # Convert to RMS
        rms = sqrt(self.vu_state)
        
        return rms
```

### Scaling and Calibration

#### dB Conversion
- VU meters display in dB relative to 0 VU reference
- Formula: `dB = 20 * log10(rms_voltage / reference_voltage)`
- Reference: 0 VU = +4 dBu = 1.228V RMS

#### PWM Scaling
```python
def scale_db_to_pwm(db_level, meter_range_db=20):
    # Typical VU meter: -20 dB to +3 dB range
    min_db = -20
    max_db = 3
    
    # Clamp to meter range
    db_clamped = max(min_db, min(max_db, db_level))
    
    # Scale to 0-100% PWM
    pwm_percent = ((db_clamped - min_db) / (max_db - min_db)) * 100
    
    return pwm_percent
```

#### Frequency Response Compensation
Standard VU meters have defined frequency response:
- Flat response: 35Hz - 10kHz
- 6dB/octave roll-off below 35Hz
- 5.6dB/octave roll-off above 10kHz

## Hardware Implementation

### PWM Configuration
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Setup PWM for meter control
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)  # Left channel
GPIO.setup(19, GPIO.OUT)  # Right channel

pwm_left = GPIO.PWM(18, 1000)   # 1kHz frequency
pwm_right = GPIO.PWM(19, 1000)

pwm_left.start(0)
pwm_right.start(0)
```

### Motor Driver Interface
- Motor drivers provide current amplification for meter movements
- Check if driver needs direction/enable pins or just PWM input
- Verify voltage/current ratings match meter requirements
- Some drivers expect differential signals - may only need one channel

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Using Existing ALSA VU Meter Plugins (Recommended)

Since AlsaPlayer already has VU meter functionality, you can leverage existing ALSA plugins designed specifically for this purpose:

#### PeppyALSA Plugin
The most suitable option - an ALSA plugin that sends audio volume levels to a named pipe:

```bash
# ALSA Configuration (/etc/asound.conf)
pcm.peppyalsa {
    type peppyalsa
    slave.pcm "hw:1,0"     # Your I2S DAC
    file "/tmp/vu_meter_data"
    channels 2
    decay_ms 500           # VU decay time
    peak_ms 400           # Peak hold time
}

# AlsaPlayer uses this device instead of direct hardware
pcm.alsaplayer_out {
    type plug
    slave.pcm peppyalsa
}
```

#### Audio Flow with PeppyALSA
AlsaPlayer → PeppyALSA Plugin → (splits to) → I2S DAC + VU Data Pipe

#### Python VU Reader for PeppyALSA
```python
import struct
import numpy as np
from threading import Thread

class PeppyVUReader:
    def __init__(self, pipe_path="/tmp/vu_meter_data"):
        self.pipe_path = pipe_path
        self.running = True
        
    def start_monitoring(self):
        Thread(target=self._reader_thread, daemon=True).start()
        
    def _reader_thread(self):
        while self.running:
            try:
                with open(self.pipe_path, 'rb') as pipe:
                    while self.running:
                        # PeppyALSA sends level data in specific format
                        data = pipe.read(8)  # Adjust based on plugin format
                        if len(data) == 8:
                            left_level, right_level = struct.unpack('ff', data)
                            self.update_physical_meters(left_level, right_level)
            except (FileNotFoundError, BrokenPipeError):
                time.sleep(0.1)
                
    def update_physical_meters(self, left_level, right_level):
        # Convert levels to PWM values for your motor drivers
        left_pwm = self.level_to_pwm(left_level)
        right_pwm = self.level_to_pwm(right_level)
        
        # Update hardware VU meters
        pwm_channels['left'].ChangeDutyCycle(left_pwm)
        pwm_channels['right'].ChangeDutyCycle(right_pwm)
```

#### PiVuMeter Alternative
Another ALSA plugin option specifically designed for Raspberry Pi:
- Built-in decay and peak hold timing
- Configurable brightness control
- Already designed for RPi hardware output
- Can be modified to drive PWM instead of LEDs

### Option 2: AlsaPlayer Scope Plugin Integration

AlsaPlayer includes a "Levelmeter" scope plugin that you could potentially:
- Modify to output data to your hardware
- Use as a reference for proper VU ballistics
- Integrate with existing AlsaPlayer configuration

### Option 3: Custom ALSA Tee Implementation

If existing plugins don't meet your needs, implement the ALSA tee approach described earlier:

```bash
# Custom ALSA configuration
pcm.vu_monitor {
    type plug
    slave.pcm "tee_device"
}

pcm.tee_device {
    type multi
    slaves {
        a { pcm "hw:1,0" }      # I2S DAC
        b { pcm "vu_fifo" }     # VU data stream
    }
    bindings {
        0 { slave a channel 0 }
        1 { slave a channel 1 }
        2 { slave b channel 0 }
        3 { slave b channel 1 }
    }
}
```

## Software Architecture

### Real-time Audio Processing (Custom Implementation)
```python
# Main processing loop structure (if not using existing plugins)
def audio_processing_loop():
    while running:
        # Read I2S buffer or named pipe
        audio_samples = read_audio_source()
        
        # Process each channel
        for channel in ['left', 'right']:
            samples = audio_samples[channel]
            
            # Apply VU ballistics
            rms_level = vu_meter[channel].process_buffer(samples)
            
            # Convert to dB
            db_level = 20 * log10(rms_level / vu_reference)
            
            # Scale to PWM
            pwm_value = scale_db_to_pwm(db_level)
            
            # Update meter
            pwm_channels[channel].ChangeDutyCycle(pwm_value)
```
