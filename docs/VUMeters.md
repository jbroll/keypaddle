# RPi-Controlled VU Meter Display Project Summary

## Project Overview
Building a digital audio system with authentic analog VU meters on the front panel, combining the aesthetic appeal of real meters with the precision and flexibility of digital control.

## Power Solutions for VU Meter Lamps

### Initial Considerations
- VU meter lamps typically spec'd for 6V AC
- USB-C supplies provide 5V DC (would work at ~70% brightness)
- 6V AC RMS = ~8.5V peak, so 5V DC gives about 70% power (5²/6² = 0.69)

### Final Solution: RPi PWM Control
Since RPi is already in the system:
- Use RPi PWM output (GPIO 12, 13, 18, or 19)
- Motor driver board as power amplifier
- PWM frequency >100Hz (ideally 1kHz+) to avoid flicker
- Enables software brightness control, automation, and remote adjustment

## VU Meter Movement Specifications

### Electrical Characteristics
- **Voltage**: 1-3V DC across meter movement
- **Current**: 1-5mA for full-scale deflection (some precision units use 200µA)
- **Internal Resistance**: 1kΩ to 5kΩ typical
- **Drive Method**: RPi GPIO through motor driver (GPIO can source several mA at 3.3V)

### Standard VU Meter Characteristics
- Based on ANSI C16.5-1942 standard
- 0 VU = +4 dBu = 1.228V RMS
- Logarithmic response (dB scale)
- Specific ballistics requirements (see below)

## Audio Processing and VU Ballistics

### Signal Chain
1. **Audio Monitoring**: Tap I2S audio stream before DAC
2. **RMS Calculation**: Process audio samples for RMS level
3. **VU Ballistics**: Apply proper integration time and response
4. **Scaling**: Convert to appropriate PWM duty cycle
5. **Output**: Drive meter movement via PWM/motor driver

### VU Meter Ballistics Implementation

#### Standard VU Response Characteristics
- **Integration Time**: 300ms time constant
- **Rise Time**: 99% of steady-state reading in 300ms
- **Overshoot**: Minimal overshoot on transients
- **Frequency Weighting**: Flat response 35Hz-10kHz, with defined roll-off outside this range

#### Mathematical Implementation
```python
# VU Ballistics Algorithm (simplified)
class VUMeter:
    def __init__(self, sample_rate=44100):
        self.fs = sample_rate
        self.tc = 0.3  # 300ms time constant
        self.alpha = 1 - exp(-1/(self.fs * self.tc))  # smoothing factor
        self.vu_state = 0
        
    def process_sample(self, audio_sample):
        # Calculate instantaneous power
        power = audio_sample ** 2
        
        # Apply VU ballistics (exponential smoothing)
        self.vu_state = self.alpha * power + (1 - self.alpha) * self.vu_state
        
        # Convert to RMS
        rms = sqrt(self.vu_state)
        
        return rms
```

### Scaling and Calibration

#### dB Conversion
- VU meters display in dB relative to 0 VU reference
- Formula: `dB = 20 * log10(rms_voltage / reference_voltage)`
- Reference: 0 VU = +4 dBu = 1.228V RMS

#### PWM Scaling
```python
def scale_db_to_pwm(db_level, meter_range_db=20):
    # Typical VU meter: -20 dB to +3 dB range
    min_db = -20
    max_db = 3
    
    # Clamp to meter range
    db_clamped = max(min_db, min(max_db, db_level))
    
    # Scale to 0-100% PWM
    pwm_percent = ((db_clamped - min_db) / (max_db - min_db)) * 100
    
    return pwm_percent
```

#### Frequency Response Compensation
Standard VU meters have defined frequency response:
- Flat response: 35Hz - 10kHz
- 6dB/octave roll-off below 35Hz
- 5.6dB/octave roll-off above 10kHz

## Hardware Implementation

### PWM Configuration
```python
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Setup PWM for meter control
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(18, GPIO.OUT)  # Left channel
GPIO.setup(19, GPIO.OUT)  # Right channel

pwm_left = GPIO.PWM(18, 1000)   # 1kHz frequency
pwm_right = GPIO.PWM(19, 1000)

pwm_left.start(0)
pwm_right.start(0)
```

### Motor Driver Interface
- Motor drivers provide current amplification for meter movements
- Check if driver needs direction/enable pins or just PWM input
- Verify voltage/current ratings match meter requirements
- Some drivers expect differential signals - may only need one channel

## Software Architecture

### Real-time Audio Processing
```python
# Main processing loop structure
def audio_processing_loop():
    while running:
        # Read I2S buffer
        audio_samples = read_i2s_buffer()
        
        # Process each channel
        for channel in ['left', 'right']:
            samples = audio_samples[channel]
            
            # Apply VU ballistics
            rms_level = vu_meter[channel].process_buffer(samples)
            
            # Convert to dB
            db_level = 20 * log10(rms_level / vu_reference)
            
            # Scale to PWM
            pwm_value = scale_db_to_pwm(db_level)
            
            # Update meter
            pwm_channels[channel].ChangeDutyCycle(pwm_value)
```
